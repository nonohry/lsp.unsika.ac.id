Our core research methods include both media analytics (NLP, social network structure, diffusion dynamics, cross-medium interactions) and media design (apps, browser plugins, interactive data visualizations, data-grounded storytelling).

Media and the public sphere work:
- mapping and understanding public sphere conversation through semantic and network analysis methods
- surfacing unheard voices through new research on situated listening and narrative intelligence
- creating bridges across political, social and cultural boundaries through tools designed to create new connections, empathy and trust among people

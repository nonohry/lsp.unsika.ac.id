Recently, the LSM team has established a nonprofit — Cortico — to scale deployment of the group’s machine learning and media analytics R&D. Cortico’s mission is to strengthen an American public sphere weakened by political, cultural and socioeconomic isolation by building AI-based tools to help newsrooms surface often unheard voices + concerns and tell stories that engage + connect audiences on common ground.
